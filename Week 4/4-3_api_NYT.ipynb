    "\n",
    "![](../img/nytimes_start.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Most APIs are set up for developers, so you'll likely be asked to register an \"application\".  All this really entails is coming up with a name for your project, and providing your real name, organization, and email.  Note that some more popular APIs (e.g. Twitter, Facebook) will require additional information, such as a web address or mobile number.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting your API Keys\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've successfully registered, you will be assigned one or more keys, tokens, or other credentials that must be supplied to the server as part of any API call you make.  To make sure that users aren't abusing their data access privileges (e.g. by making many rapid queries), each set of keys will be given several **rate limits** governing the total number of calls that can be made over certain intervals of time.  For the NYT Article API, we have relatively generous rate limits: 10 calls per minute and 4,000 calls per day.\n",

    "\n",
    "4. You'll see the page where you'll be prompted to add a name for your App. You can call it anything. Then click enable on the APIs that are enabled in the screenshot. You can enable them all but make sure you at least enable the ones on the screenshot. \n",
