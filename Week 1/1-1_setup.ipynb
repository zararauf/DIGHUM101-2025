    "- A variety of Pythonic approaches to explore questions in the humanities;\n",
    "- How to understand data more holistically, its generative process and lifecycle;\n",
    "- Strategies for organizing research projects based on your interests;\n",
    "- Methods for data acquisition and visualization, computational text analysis, and machine learning;\n",
    "- The importance of developing a critical lens in your field of study.\n",

    "## Attendance\n",
    "This course is synchronous and attendance is required. Asynchronous exceptions will be considered on a case-by-case basis, such as for those living in distant time zones. Attendance will be tracked through Zoom sign-ins.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each class is divided into two types:\n",

    "You will choose a topic, either a methodology/approach like topic modeling or a task, like named entity recognition and identify three papers on your chosen topic. You will briefly summarize their methods, why they chose these methods, and study their code and data. You will critically evaluate the papers to understand where the weaknesses and strengths of these papers are. Your paper should be 2 pages and written in LaTeX. We will have a session dedicated to using Overleaf. \n",

    "This is an open topic project, as long as it is using humanistic data and computational methods. The main limiting factor is time. This is a six-week course. Think big, but then carve out a little slice of that big idea to focus on. Make sure to match the scope and scale of your idea to the datasets available to you. In this topic statement you will describe your idea/question and identify the dataset(s) that you will use in your project. The topic statement should be 2 pages long and written in LaTeX. We will talk more about group projects in Week 1 and datasets in Week 2.\n",

It should tell us the methods you used to answer this question. Your paper must include at least one data visualization. You should also explicitly state where your methods failed and what future research directions can be taken. You do not need to show your code in this paper but you will need to submit your code separately as a GitHub repository. \n",
