Embeddings learned through word2vec have proven to be successful on a variety of downstream natural language processing tasks.\n",

    "*   **Continuous skip-gram model**: predicts words within a certain range before and after the current word in the same sentence. A worked example of this is given below.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll use the skip-gram approach in this tutorial. First, you'll explore skip-grams and other concepts using a single sentence for illustration. Next, you'll train your own word2vec model on a small dataset.
